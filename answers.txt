Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows multiple people to work on one code base, and helps greatly with version control. Multiple 
people can work on different features on their own local machine without conflicts. There are also a lot of extensions
for IDEs that help organize Git and version control. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be very helpful for cybersecurity as the use of AI/ML can help detect
potential risks, predict future attacker behavior, and run analysis on various software components of a company. Since cybersecurity
is an ever-changing field, ML can be especially helpful for understanding what we may encounter in the future.
For best practices, data science must be utilized for research and providing insights to companies on what policies, tools, and frameworks to adapt to secure their online world.
